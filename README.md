## Introduction:

- This is a simple yet extremely powerful **Python HTTP/HTTPS Login Sniffer** script.
- It comes with the **Tusker Tnterface** for executing it to seamlessly sniff login creds.
- You can also run them standalone though I wouldn't do that (*just not built that way*)



## Installation:

 ```sudo python3 install.py```




## Execution:
 ```sudo python3 tusker_interface.py```


 
## NOTE: 

- You need sslstrip installed and running on your system while executing this tool.*
- You need to run sslstrip, then two instances of this script (one for arp spoofing other for password sniffing)*
- I recommend using a custom terminal like 'Terminator' for easy access to different terminals*
