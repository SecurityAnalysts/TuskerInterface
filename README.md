# TuskerInterface


![](https://github.com/mage-master/TuskerInterface/blob/main/banner.png)

- This is a simple yet extremely powerful **Python HTTP/HTTPS Login Sniffer** script.
- It comes with the **Tusker Tnterface** for executing it to seamlessly sniff login creds.
- You can also run them standalone though I wouldn't do that (*just not built that way*)

**NOTE**: *You need sslstrip installed and running on your system while executing this tool.*

### Executing Example

1.```sudo python3 install.py```
2.```sudo python3 tusker_interface.py```

*You need to run sslstrip, then two instances of this script (one for arp spoofing other for password sniffing)*
*I recommend using a custom terminal like 'Terminator' for easy access to different terminals*
